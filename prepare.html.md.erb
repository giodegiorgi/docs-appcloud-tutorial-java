In this step, you will prepare a simple Java web application that can be deployed.
Execute the following commands to clone the sample application:

<pre class="terminal">
$ git clone https://github.com/swisscom/cf-sample-app-java.git
$ cd cf-sample-app-java
</pre>

You now have a functioning git repository that contains a simple Java application as well as a `build.gradle` file, which is used by Gradle to manage dependencies and to build the app.
