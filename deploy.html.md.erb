<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

In this step you will deploy the app to <%= vars.product_full %>.

Before you can push it, you need to compile and build the app using Gradle. To do so, run

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build

...

:compileJava
:processResources UP-TO-DATE
:classes
:jar
:assemble
:compileTestJava UP-TO-DATE
:processTestResources UP-TO-DATE
:testClasses UP-TO-DATE
:test UP-TO-DATE
:check UP-TO-DATE
:build

BUILD SUCCESSFUL

Total time: 6.78 secs
</pre>

Gradle will build a Java archive (JAR) file of your app. It is located under `build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.jar`. The Java archive contains all dependencies needed by your app.

Push your app to the cloud by executing the following command and replacing the "my-random-hostname" with your own hostname. This will be part of the URL your app will be reached at and it has to be globally unique so be creative.

The `-p build/libs/cf-sample-app-java-1.0.jar` tells Cloud Foundry where to find the compiled application to push to the Cloud.

<pre class="terminal">

The application is now deployed. Ensure that the app is running:

<pre class="terminal">
$ cf app my-java-app

Now visit the app at the URL. You can find the URL in the `urls` property of the statement above.
