title: Declare App Dependencies

<strong><%= modified_date %></strong>

<%= vars.product_short %> uses the Java buildpack to execute the uploaded JAR file as application package. The Java buildpack will run your application using the `main()` method from the `core.clj` file.

The dependencies needed for the application are declared in the `build.gradle` file and are included in the standalone JAR. 

The `build.gradle` file of your deployed sample app looks as follows:


```
apply plugin: 'java'
...

sourceCompatibility = 1.8
version = '1.0'

jar {
    manifest {
        attributes 'Implementation-Title': 'CF Java Sample App',  
        	'Implementation-Version': version,
        	'Main-Class': 'com.swisscom.cloud.cloudfoundry.sampleapp.java.ProductService'
    }
    from {
        (configurations.runtime).collect {
            it.isDirectory() ? it : zipTree(it)
        }
    }
}

repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compile 'com.sparkjava:spark-core:2.2'
    compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.core:jackson-databind:2.6.2'
	  compile 'com.fasterxml.jackson.datatype:jackson-datatype-jsr310:2.6.2'	
   	testCompile 'junit:junit:4.12'
    testCompile 'org.mockito:mockito-core:1.10.19'
}

...
```

The `build.gradle` file declares both the version of Java that will be used to run your application on <%= vars.product_short %>, as well as the dependencies that should be installed with your application.

To install the required dependencies, simply compile/build your application with:

<pre class="terminal">
$ gradle build
